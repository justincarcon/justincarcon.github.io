        <strong>Expert advice on BC EA Certificates</strong>
      </u>
      <br>
      <br>The wording in EA Certificates must be easy to understand and practical to implement. Justin Carlson Consulting Corporation can provide advice and guidance in the development process of conditions, or assistance in the interpretation and implementation of these certificates.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><u>Compliance with EA Certificates
        <br>
        </u></strong>
      <br>
      <br>Compliance with EA Certificates can be challenging. The language is often open to interpretation which can lead to surprising revelations when inspected by regulatory agencies. This, coupled with increased public scrutiny and rising costs in labour and materials can lead to costly delays and damaged reputation. Justin Carlson Consulting Corporation, and its partners, can help your Project in the regulatory interpretation of Certificate requirements to potentially avoid or mitigate costly enforcement.
      <br>
      <br>The three most common non-compliances on major Projects in BC seem to centre around erosion sediment control, attractants/waste and spills. Regulators are always on the lookout for these items and failure to ensure that these items are addressed in manner suitable to regulators can lead to costly delays and impacts to public image. Justin Carlson Consulting Corporation and its partners can aid in assessing and reducing regulatory risk through a solutions based approach. In addition to the above, Justin Carlson Consulting Corporation can also review your regulatory authorizations and provide advice or guidance on meeting those requirements and lessening your compliance risk.
      <br>
      <br>
      <u>
        <strong>Clear and Practical Management Plans<br></strong>
      </u>
      <br>
      <br>Regulators are often inspecting against the mitigation contained within management plans that are tied to EA Certificate requirements. Vague or impractical language can often lead to enforcement. We can provide you with advice on regulatory interpretations and guidance to potentially prevent or mitigate non-compliances and enforcement. We can review draft plans prior to approval, or plans after the approval for potential risk and solutions.
      <br>
      <br>
      <u>
        <strong>Risk Assessment</strong>
      </u>
      <br>
      <br>The EA process and compliance with EA Certificates both come with a wide range of risks that can pop out of nowhere. Our EAO and industry experience allows us to bring fresh eyes to identify the risks facing your team. Our experience with issues in the interface between proponents, regulators, and Prime contractors means we see risks others may not. We help you develop clear, practical strategies to get ahead of the issues.

        <strong>Our Expertise</strong>
      </u>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">Justin Carlson Consulting Corporation is not like the big environmental firms. While many of them deal with a breadth of environmental-related concerns, we specialize in EAO projects. 
        <br>
        <br>When you partner with us, you get strategic advice targeted to the specific requirements of the EAO.
        <br>Getting an EA Certificate and then constructing a project that complies with it can be challenging. Justin Carlson Consulting Corporation has extensive experience in understanding the challenges through the lens of industry. We get the need to balance schedule, budget, reputation, and regulatory matters. We provide advice and guidance to make the process easier and proactively identify potential roadblocks.
        <br>
        <br>From ‘boots on the ground’ up to executives and politicians, we understand how regulators and all levels of government address EA issues. Our experience helps you stay ahead of problems.
